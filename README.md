Calculator Web App

Objective:  To create a basic, functional calculator utilizing HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS
            Along the way I hoped to re-familiarize myself with HTML & CSS page structure
            and use it as an opportunity to develop with JavaScript as this is a significant
            area of interest.


What I learned:

          - The use of 'div' element as a container for HTML elements which made
            CSS styling and associating JavaScript tasks easier.

          - Use of 'border-box' for box-sizing which makes it easier to size our
            elements when styling them in CSS.

          - CSS Grid Layout which made designing the User Interface easy as everything
            was contained within a formatted layout.    

          - Debugging utilizing 'Inspect Element' as well as 'Web Console'

          - Developing a class for calculator to contain all functionality of the Calculator
            such as a constructor() to create the Calculator object, Clear(),
            Delete(), as well as all of the basic arithmetic operations.

          - Appropriately handling conversions between strings and numbers to ensure that
            JS handles the numbers and the operations performed on them as we intend.

          - Utilizing 'toLocaleString' method to ensure our number displays ',' at
            appropriate instances, as this method ensures our string will properly
            represent our number.     


Functionality:
            Basic web app calculator that is able to compute various operations on numbers
            such as addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, equals.
            Additional functionality includes 'AC' (All Clear), 'DEL' (Delete), and you are
            able to use '.' for decimal numbers.
